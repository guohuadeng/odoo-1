Private Thread and Discussions
==============================
The app is a tool to communicate with colleagues without interrupting followers. Odoo default functionality assumes that each time you send a message all subscribers (including your partners) are notified. As an alternative you may log an internal note without notifications. This approach hardly suits in a case you would like to communicate something important only to your colleague.
This app let avoid excess emails but simultaneously notify required partners.
* Notifications are not sent to the followers disregarding their subscription
* Messages are visible for ones who may see the parent object except portal users
* In order to send such a message it is enough to flag a check box on email composer form
* You may use an app also to check system messages such as sending a quotation to a customers
* The app equally works for all objects (sales orders, invoices, issues, etc.)
