Requirements and exceptions
===========================
* The modules depends on the module 'super_mail'. Make sure you have source code before get started
* Be cautious: some modules re-write subscription policies. E.g. if portal_sale is installed the module would not work for sales orders. Have a look at the module 'sale_no_auto_subscribe' to learn how to avoid it
